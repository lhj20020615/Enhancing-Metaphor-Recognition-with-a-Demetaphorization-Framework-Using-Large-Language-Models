1	While he suggests in apocalyptic tones in The Problem of Method that this process of self-consciousness is at last beginning to take place , and that civil , foreign and colonial wars are becoming apparent as different forms of a single class struggle , Sartre also admits that the divorce between theory and praxis which ensued under Stalinism has generally prevented any clear self-consciousness among the masses .	49

0	For geographers who span the conventional( and now archaic) dichotomy between the natural and the environmental sciences all of these aspects need to be woven together to anticipate the likely spatial patterns of the effects of massive change, the redistributions in trade, health and wealth which they will bring about and the knock on effects these consequences themselves will have on society and the environment.	39

1	Sartre 's reaction to the threat that the negation of a negation may produce a detotalizing effect is to introduce a new category , a unifying force of a ????singularization ????which incarnates the universal : ????If totalization really is an ongoing process ????, he writes , ????then it operates everywhere .	26

1	They are at a stage when they are likely to be concerned with a variety of complex issues ; the meaning of life , the existence of God , ideologies , their emerging sexuality , their future career and life-style ????too often science is seen as being purely instrumental with nothing to contribute to these debates .	4
1	There is , therefore , before any understanding of historic agents and movements , a certain aporia in all social ensembles : from afar they may appear whole , but close to , they can be seen as riddled with holes .	20
1	Sartre produces a persuasive formulation of the relation of the individual to the determining historical circumstance through his concepts of praxis and the practico-inert ; it is also obvious to him how the larger question of History ought to be solved .	4

1	So , although it is possible to conceive of any event as an incarnation of the totality , insofar as it must itself make up a part of that totality in its determination , unlike the case of the boxing match , where we can define the overall entity ????boxing ????, it still remains unproven that an overall entity , ????History ????, can be said to exist at all .	13

1	For example Roe ( 1952 ) , Eiduson ( 1962 ) and McClelland ( 1962 ) suggested that male scientists often experienced a lonely childhood , perhaps suffering social isolation through illness or family circumstances , so that they developed a strong interest in their surrounding material world and a below average interest in other people and relationships .	52

0	Pearce( 1990), for instance, presented an economist's views of the high-priority topics for research as follows:	10
1	Marxism is rigorously true if History is totalization ; it is not so any more if human history decomposes into a plurality of particular histories , or if , in any case , within the relationship of immanence that characterizes struggle , the negation of each adversary by the other is on principle detotalizing .	46

1	What Sartre needs to demonstrate , therefore , is that if the law of the dialectic works from the individual level , overall it produces nothing less than the intelligibility or the meaning of History as such :	20
1	While he suggests in apocalyptic tones in The Problem of Method that this process of self-consciousness is at last beginning to take place , and that civil , foreign and colonial wars are becoming apparent as different forms of a single class struggle , Sartre also admits that the divorce between theory and praxis which ensued under Stalinism has generally prevented any clear self-consciousness among the masses .	66
1	Accordingly , he attempted to shift Marxism away from orthodox theories of an absolute determinism towards the primacy of a concept of ????History ????which , while still a totality as it had been for Luk????cs , a process with a determinate meaning and end , could also include a concept of human agency and thus articulate the individual with the social , freedom with determinism .	45
1	And in this sense it must be said that the Resistance experience , by making us believe that politics is a relationship between man and man or between consciousnesses , fostered our illusions of 1939 and masked the truth of the incredible power of history which the Occupation taught us in another connection .	42
1	Unlike the others who appear and disappear as fashion and progress dictate , children occupy a permanent place in the list partly because of their continuing presence as a potential sub-class , partly because they have never protested and mainly because it is assumed that in favourable circumstances they will become men and therefore require attention .	26

0	As far as we know the microcomputer-based emergency response system devised by Belardo et al.( 1983), is the only GIS-like software to incorporate this algorithm.	24
1	For the whole basis of Sartre 's argument is that the dialectic of history is not a metaphysical law , ????some powerful unitary force revealing itself behind History like the will of God ????, but the continuously produced effect of individual conflicts ; each action is in its turn subsumed as a part of the whole in an ever broader , developing totalization ( I , 37 ) .	24
1	At this point Sartre confronts the possibility that the whole project of the Critique , stated so confidently on its very first page ????????it must be proved that a negation of a negation can be an affirmation ????( I , 15 ) ????may break down .	34

1	Eventually these persons might have to face up to period of crisis , of self-examination , and so achieve ego-identity by route C. However , foreclosure does offer an escape route and an individual might postpone indefinitely any real self-examination by clinging rigidly to his or her beliefs and values ( route D ) .	51
1	Unfortunately , this evidence has tended to be fragmentary , a collection of separate , discrete pieces of information lacking a synthesizing theory to provide cohesion and predictive power .	16

1	In the context of the negativity of this formulation , Sartre is obliged to pose once again the problem of whether there can be a totalization , without any independent totalizer or totalizing force such as the dialectic , or whether the structure of negation that he has described means that , as for Adorno or Bakhtin , history does not develop positively but , rather , negatively , and is therefore instead detotalizing :	44

1	Rationality turns into narrow intellectualism , freedom into licence , independence into isolationism , dignity into selfish pride ; the autonomous human being turns out to be no more than a social atom after all .	6
1	In the context of the negativity of this formulation , Sartre is obliged to pose once again the problem of whether there can be a totalization , without any independent totalizer or totalizing force such as the dialectic , or whether the structure of negation that he has described means that , as for Adorno or Bakhtin , history does not develop positively but , rather , negatively , and is therefore instead detotalizing :	42

1	Sartre 's stress on the role of the subject also finds approval because many of those no longer prepared to argue for a general theory of history as the progress of a single narrative of class-struggle , have begun to argue instead for a return of its correlative , the subject , almost as if it was the next best thing in the absence of history itself .	29
