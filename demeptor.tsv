0	"In other words , does English criminal law pick out the most heinous forms of killing as murders and manslaughters , or are the definitions fixed by tradition ?"	24
0	It was argued in Chapter 2 that the criminal law ought to extend its scope wider where the potential harm is greater.	14
0	"The mandatory penalty does indeed serve to mark out murder from other crimes , but whether the definition of murder is sufficiently refined to specify the worst killings , and only the worst killings , remains to be discussed below ."	24
0	"The same applies to the general deterrent argument : its effectiveness depends on whether the penalty for murder affects the considerations of potential killers at all , and , if it does , whether life imprisonment is seen as significantly more or less severe than the alternative of a long , fixed-term sentence ."	20
0	"In procedural terms , therefore , the life sentence involves a delegation of responsibility : normally it is the judge who determines the sentence ( or at least its upper limit , since earlier release on parole may be possible ) , whereas a life sentence entrusts that function to the executive , who must first ascertain the opinions of the Lord Chief Justice and the trial judge ."	11
0	"Whatever the justifications for introducing this policy , it serves to emphasize the fact that sentencing in murder cases is enacted without each case being considered individually , after hearing representations from the offender 's counsel , and without a sentence announced in court and subject to appeal ."	11
0	"That proposal , if implemented , would shift almost all the decision-making in homicide cases from the trial to the sentencing stage : the only issue of any consequence in most cases would be the sentence to be imposed , and all the distinctions now drawn at the stage of criminal liability would be reflected in the sentence alone ."	7
0	"Moreover , the distinctions between the various degrees would raise questions of law , which would provide much opportunity for legal argument and for appeals ."	3
0	"The result would be that killings were classified and labelled in a more refined way , but at the expense of lengthy trials and increasing legal-aid bills ."	19
0	"That would have the merit of simplicity, but would it strike the right tone socially?"	11

0	"In discussing the definition of murder , we are concerned with categories , not exculpation ."	3
0	Can a satisfactory boundary be drawn here ?	3
0	"Admittedly , the Model Penal Code does contain a list of circumstances which may amount to extreme indifference , which assists the courts and increases the predictability of verdicts in a way that Scots law does not , but the core of both approaches is that there is no precise way of describing those non-intentional killings which are as heinous as intentional killings ."	43
0	"Neither an intention to cause serious injury nor recklessness as to death should be sufficient on its own , but together they restrict one another , producing a standard which both satisfies the criterion of certainty and exclude out some heinous but non-intended killings ."	37

0	One is to acquire a human employee for each level of staff.	6
0	The most serious consequence of the accountancy view of human resources is that high level policy decision-making does not give this factor sufficient weight.	22
0	"For example , the main board of a company will have complete details of cost and values of physical resources such as buildings and equipment but relatively scanty data about the man-power which is their most important resource ."	37

0	In well ordered systems it may be possible to calculate the duration of in-house experience required to achieve the required level of expertise in particular topics and compare this with the development time for particular product requirements.	11

0	"Similarly , campaigning in the field imposed an increasing financial cost ."	10
0	"The divergence was sharpened by the application of a theoretical concept , the distinction of Augustinian theology , amplified as the century went on by canon and Roman law reference ; princes pronounced their campaigns just wars ( fought against aggressors with the aim of re-establishing peace ) or public wars ( declared by a competent authority in the public interest ) , while they condemned the wars of lesser men as infractions of the peace ."	13
0	The contrast with the united group Louis VI and his troops presented to the emperor Henry V in 1124 was marked.	5
0	"This goes some distance to explaining why the complicated campaigns within Toulouse in the second half of the century were largely fought out under the leadership of the Angevin , Aragonese , and French kings ; and why the revolts of Henry II 's sons had widespread ramifications ."	3
0	"The situation caused problems , in that the circumstances which might trigger off renewed fighting were unpredictable ; yet the moment an opportunity offered , princes had to be prepared for attacking their enemies ; there was no time for lengthy preparation ."	1

0	"It was within this kind of environment that chivalry flourished, that young men learned to identify, their service towards their lord as a symbol of their honour, that they debated the relative merits of Roland's and Oliver's way of displaying loyalty; and that they learned the finer points of jousting."	25
0	All this formed a context to the first century of crusading ; and it goes some way to explaining the more secular aspects of the magnetism which drew French knights to take up the cross in their thousands .	4
0	"Yet for them crusading necessitated no large leap of the imagination , no millenarian belief ; it was simply a challenging and a deserving continuation of their everyday activities ."	14
0	For other French houses a commitment to overseas territories often represented a sacrifice of domestic political interest.	11
0	"On occasion , their determination to sacrifice for Christ played directly into their overlord 's advantage , as when the count of La Marche , who had no direct heir , sold his county to King Henry II in 1177 ."	15
0	"When it did not , accompanying their princes in a joint military campaign , as the lord of Amboise accompanied Fulk V or Hugh VI de Lusignan William IX , created new personal bonds ."	33

0	"Before he succeeded Balfour then, Law was not associated with any of the features that were to characterize his party leadership; his contribution was to use the leadership in the service of all of these causes, to make himself the representative for the most spirited sections of the party."	32
0	Law conceived of the role of the leader in an exactly opposite sense from Balfour : he sought to foster unity by placing himself at the front of the discordant factions where Balfour had thrown the leadership on the side of restraint .	30
0	"In later conversations about Ulster , Law was frank enough to point out that violence in Ulster would be the best way of ensuring an electoral victory for the Unionists ."	26
