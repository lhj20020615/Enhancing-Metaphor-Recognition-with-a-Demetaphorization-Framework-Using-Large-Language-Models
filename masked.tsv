He chuckled, produced two cardboard cups, and poured me a generous 【】 of the whiskey.	Any of many terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusks, having no  shell.
Chatterton raised his cardboard cup in silent acknowledgement, then stared ahead to where a great 【】 swept around the sky.	Any large piece of timber or iron long in proportion to its thickness, and prepared for use.
I explained all that to Chatterton, but stressed that we would run for 【】 at the first sign of trouble.	A lid.
That's when the real 【】 begins.	A place or situation of great suffering in life.

The sounds are the same as those of daylight, yet somehow the night magnifies and sharpens the creak of a yielding block, the 【】 of air over a shroud, the stretching of a sail, the hiss of water sliding sleek against the hull, the curl of a quarter-wave falling away, and the thump as a wave strikes the cutwater to be sheared into two bright slices of whiteness.	A deep, prolonged audible inhale and exhale of breath; as when fatigued, frustrated, grieved, or relieved; the act of sighing.

In recent years there has been a steady accumulation of evidence that personality and allied affective factors play a crucial 【】 in determining subject choice and student success.	A character or part played by a performer or actor.
Unfortunately, this evidence has tended to be fragmentary, a collection of separate, discrete pieces of information lacking a 【】 theory to provide cohesion and predictive power.	An act of making synthesis.
Maslow( 1966) and Hudson( 1966 and 1968) saw science as providing an emotionally undemanding activity appealing to boys moving from the calm of latency to the 【】 of adolescence.	The state or fact of being turbulent or agitated; tempestuousness, disturbance.
Even if these descriptions are valid they still leave open a number of questions, particularly why the same 【】 do not operate with girls.	Any mechanical means for the conversion or control of motion, or the transmission or control of power.
Similar questions, when asked of boys, tend to produce banal responses or exploitative ones, for example the parent is seen as the 【】 of money.	The person, place, or thing from which something  comes or is acquired.
If we compare boys of 14 years of age who opt for science with other boys, we find that the former have very cut-and-dried 【】 on many issues.	Visual perception.

We can now make the 【】 between this model of adolescent development and subject choice in schools.	A connection between places, people, events, things, or ideas.
Science, with its masculine 【】 makes little emotional demand on an individual and seems to offer clear, precise answers to problems.	An optical or other representation of a real object; a graphic; a picture.

Furthermore, these girls will tend to go into a career with a feminine 【】 one which already attracts many girls.	An optical or other representation of a real object; a graphic; a picture.
Consequently, very few girls at the 【】 stage will enter science unless they receive considerable encouragement and a model to do so from their parents and their school.	the proceeding, by a creditor, to regain property or other collateral following a default on mortgage payments
In fact, most girls entering science are probably at this 【】 as they will need some self-examination and sense of commitment to make this unconventional choice.	A phase.
A large number of boys, particularly at the foreclosure stage, are initially attracted to science but there is a 【】 away throughout later adolescence as they undergo some crisis.	Movement; that which moves or is moved.
The preponderance of boys at the 【】 stage will yield the rigid, authoritarian attitudes often associated with scientists.	the proceeding, by a creditor, to regain property or other collateral following a default on mortgage payments
The few girls who enter science will not usually show these 【】 characteristics.	the proceeding, by a creditor, to regain property or other collateral following a default on mortgage payments
In the development through the years of adolescence the number of 【】 pupils will diminish, hence the recruitment of boys into science would be cut.	the proceeding, by a creditor, to regain property or other collateral following a default on mortgage payments
It might make it easier for girls at the 【】 stage to accept science so recruitment might increase.	the proceeding, by a creditor, to regain property or other collateral following a default on mortgage payments
Clearly there would need to be some drastic 【】 of content.	A removal of excess material from a tree or shrub.
The difference is that we are now offering a formal psychological model to suggest that if we want to reduce the current 【】 of science, if we want to recruit a different sort of student, then certain curriculum changes are needed.	The act of enclosing in a capsule; the growth of a membrane around  so as to enclose it in a capsule.
GIST had more success in altering children's attitudes than their subject choices, suggesting that it is easier to change 【】 and beliefs than actual behaviour.	The position of the body or way of carrying oneself.
VISTA made science more girl friendly in two ways: both boys and girls were offered an attractive image of a competent woman scientist, and talks concentrated on social and industrial applications of science, an 【】 too often missing from science at school.	One of the simplest or essential parts or principles of which anything consists, or upon which the constitution or fundamental powers of anything are based.
For a more girl friendly science, it seems vital that teachers should come to see that when all the masculine 【】 evident in textbooks and resources as well as teachers' and boys' behaviour in the classroom, is removed, girls can be very enthusiastic about science. ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦	The act of packing something.
Over against the German army or the Vichy government, where social generality ruled, as it does in all 【】 of state, the Resistance offered the rare phenomenon of historical action which remained personal.	A device that directs and controls energy, often in the form of movement or electricity, to produce a certain effect.
It is only too obvious that this 【】 between action and personal life was intimately bound up with the conditions of clandestine action and could not survive it.	A state in which opposing forces harmonise; equilibrium.
And in this sense it must be said that the Resistance experience, by making us believe that politics is a 【】 between man and man or between consciousnesses, fostered our illusions of 1939 and masked the truth of the incredible power of history which the Occupation taught us in another connection.	Connection or association; the condition of being related.

Ability to do or undergo something.
Sartre's stress on the role of the 【】 also finds approval because many of those no longer prepared to argue for a general theory of history as the progress of a single narrative of class-struggle, have begun to argue instead for a return of its correlative, the subject, almost as if it was the next best thing in the absence of history itself.	In a clause: the word or word group  about whom the statement is made. In active clauses with verbs denoting an action, the subject and the actor are usually the same.

But it still leaves us with the crucial problem that Sartre had to solve, namely how to link human consciousness with the processes of history so that the former can be said to be the 【】 of the latter.	One who exerts power, or has the power to act
Sartre considered that orthodox dialectical materialism takes the easy way out by merely eliminating the first in favour of the second, making man a passive 【】 entirely determined by economic circumstances.	A commodity offered for sale.
Unwilling to follow Merleau-Ponty by dropping the second in favour of the first, Sartre argued that it was possible for man to be both at once through the 【】 of praxis, that is intentional actions which produce material effects.	Physical motion between points in space.
What Sartre needs to demonstrate, therefore, is that if the 【】 of the dialectic works from the individual level, overall it produces nothing less than the intelligibility or the meaning of History as such:	The body of binding rules and regulations, customs, and standards established in a community by its legislative and judicial authorities.
But what produces the overall 【】 of History?	A theoretical line  followed from a point of origin or towards a destination. May be relative , geographical , rotational , or with respect to an object or location .
The dialectic is the 【】 that remains hidden.	The body of binding rules and regulations, customs, and standards established in a community by its legislative and judicial authorities.
While he suggests in apocalyptic tones in The Problem of Method that this process of self-consciousness is at last beginning to take place, and that civil, foreign and colonial wars are becoming apparent as different 【】 of a single class struggle, Sartre also admits that the divorce between theory and praxis which ensued under Stalinism has generally prevented any clear self-consciousness among the masses.	To do with shape.

Sartre's account thus sets up the articulation of history, univocal meaning, and totality as the indissoluble set of 【】 required for the validation of Marxism, necessary in order to save it from its detour from itself.	One of the simplest or essential parts or principles of which anything consists, or upon which the constitution or fundamental powers of anything are based.

How can History be a unity if it is also conflictual, if each action is aimed at destroying the other and results in a double negation in which the original 【】 of each action have been destroyed by the other?	The pointing of a weapon, as a gun, a dart, or an arrow, or object, in the line of direction with the object intended to be struck; the line of fire; the direction of anything, such as a spear, a blow, a discourse, a remark, towards a particular point or object, with a view to strike or affect it.

This increasingly comes to resemble nothing so much as Sartre's own 【】 of History.	A registry of pecuniary transactions; a written or printed statement of business dealings or debts and credits, and also of other things subjected to a reckoning or review.
In the context of the negativity of this formulation, Sartre is obliged to pose once again the problem of whether there can be a totalization, without any independent totalizer or totalizing 【】 such as the dialectic, or whether the structure of negation that he has described means that, as for Adorno or Bakhtin, history does not develop positively but, rather, negatively, and is therefore instead detotalizing:	Strength or energy of body or mind; active power; vigour; might; capacity of exercising an influence or producing an effect.

Certainly, we have neither the 【】 nor the actual possibility of showing here the full truth of dialectical materialism ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦	A specification of an object or process, referring to requirements to be satisfied and thus conditions to be met for them to solve a problem.
Our goal is solely to establish whether, in a practical ensemble torn apart by antagonism( whether there are multiple conflicts or whether they are reduced to one) the 【】 themselves are totalizing and carried along by the totalizing movement of the ensemble.

perhaps the Truth of History can not be proved; its 【】 can not be discerned.	A theoretical line  followed from a point of origin or towards a destination. May be relative , geographical , rotational , or with respect to an object or location .
That means both that there is a dialectical meaning of the practical ensemble ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ and that each singular event totalizes in itself the practical 【】 in the infinite richness of its singularity( II, 26).	A group of separate things that contribute to a coordinated whole.

This 【】 marks a structure of repetition in Sartre's text: each time he poses the question of how there can be totalization of History without a totalizer, he retreats to a more limited example whose unity is already evident, but which in the end only brings him back to the original question again.	The science and art of military command as applied to the overall planning and conduct of warfare.
Its totalization takes place through its 【】 as part of the totality of boxing, in the overall framework within which each individual fight occurs.	An incarnate being or form.
Its totalization takes place through its incarnation, as part of the totality of boxing, in the overall 【】 within which each individual fight occurs.	A support structure comprising joined parts or conglomerated particles and intervening open spaces of similar or larger size.
Each boxing match, Sartre claims, must be both a unique event and also in some sense the 【】 of all boxing, whose rules and conventions it follows, and whose past and future history it sets itself against.	An incarnate being or form.
But it is also apparent that that totality is not completely known, nor is its future 【】 even presumed.	The status or condition of something
By totalization, therefore, Sartre does not here mean anything like a predetermined end or final closure of a totality but rather a process of 【】 among the parts, where each is determined by the other.	Negotiation to resolve differences conducted by an impartial party.
No one can predict the future of boxing, either at the level of particular victories or defeats, in effect a 【】 of repetition, nor at the more general level of possible modifications or developments of the sport.	A cohesive whole built up of distinct parts.
Yet each individual bout articulates itself within the 【】 of the history of boxing, known and unknown.	A support structure comprising joined parts or conglomerated particles and intervening open spaces of similar or larger size.
But what about those conflicts that do not take place within such a constituted social system, such as conflictual bourgeois societies which can not be said to be unified, except, as Sartre suggests dismissively, by appeal to a lost 【】 before the class struggle?	The place where sanctified souls are believed to live after death.
The major question thus always remains unanswered in the Critique: every time that Sartre announces that he is about to proceed with the fundamental problem of how History can be a totalization without a totalizer, he turns back to a previous, more easily intelligible 【】 on the way.	A phase.
Without an adequate theory of their 【】 they simply begin to separate again.	A joint or the collection of joints at which something is articulated, or hinged, for bending.
Unlike the others who appear and disappear as 【】 and progress dictate, children occupy a permanent place in the list partly because of their continuing presence as a potential sub-class, partly because they have never protested and mainly because it is assumed that in favourable circumstances they will become men and therefore require attention.	A current  trend, favored for frivolous rather than practical, logical, or intellectual reasons.
Education was to guide the infant through the transition to manhood including such 【】 as childhood, boyhood and youth.	A phase.
Education has been directed at the 【】 of the rational, the free, the independent of mind, the dignified, in short, the autonomous human being.	The act of producing, making or creating something.
Yet because the philosopher's adult has traditionally been male, his children boy children, and his educational programmes designed to facilitate the transition between them, the ideal of the fully human person has been masculinised to the 【】 where otherwise thoughtful and sometimes good and wise men have unashamedly admitted that this defining ideal is not applicable to half the species.	A discrete division of something.
Rationality turns into narrow intellectualism, freedom into licence, independence into isolationism, dignity into selfish pride; the autonomous human being turns out to be no more than a social 【】 after all.

Having denied that we may ever legitimately interfere with the liberty of another except on the 【】 of self-protection, Mill( 1910) asserts:	The surface of the Earth, as opposed to the sky or water or underground.
I shall suggest that this does not follow because rationality is not in fact the 【】 for the distinction in the first place.	The surface of the Earth, as opposed to the sky or water or underground.
First of all, let us remind ourselves of the traditional 【】 of children drawn for us by some great philosophers of the past.	A representation of anything  upon canvas, paper, or other surface, by drawing, painting, printing, photography, etc.
Roughly at the age of ten years, when by nature the child enters the 【】 of youth and begins to reflect ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦	A phase.

In all this, there are perhaps a couple of things which look plausible when we compare the philosopher's child with our mental 【】 Aristotle's observation that children are immature and Mill's suggestion that they might need protection.	A representation of anything  upon canvas, paper, or other surface, by drawing, painting, printing, photography, etc.
Apart from being false, such an account leaves no 【】 in our thinking about children for things like teaching and learning, or development in understanding and character and all those other concepts which refer to processes and not to states.	Opportunity or scope .
Well, maybe they do, but making any old noises is clearly not sufficient to enter the rationality 【】 I must at least say something.	A piece of wood or other material, usually long and slender, pointed at one end so as to be easily driven into the ground as a marker or a support or stay.

The one thing they do not do is to re-examine the original for the tell-tale signs of 【】	The act of forging metal into shape.
The recognition that children can not simply be written off in the rationality 【】 and can not therefore be denied autonomy on this account has led some writers to conclude that they can not, therefore, be denied it on any account.

Like Holt, Harris believes that the so-called incompetence of children is an adult 【】 imposed on children for adults' convenience.	Something invented.
We must remember that to deny someone control of their own lives is to offer them a most profound insult, not to mention the which the frustration of their wishes and the 【】 at naught of their own plans for themselves will add.

Both of them appear to suffer from a form of mental 【】 in imagining the consequences of such proposals, and I am not here referring only to Mill-type consequences of harm brought about by unwise decisions.

VIRGIL THOMSON was a composer and writer of originality , courage and wit formed by a unique 【】 of American and French influences .	
These influences laid the 【】 for the blend of the naive and the sophisticated which is the hallmark of Thomson 's maturity .	
In 1936 , three years before Aaron Copland , Thomson started writing film scores which were a model of unobtrusive clarity and pertinence , combining American 【】 to suit documentaries such as The Plow that Broke the Plains and The River with the musique d'ameublement approach of Satie .	
Another response to a visual stimulus was Thomson 's series of musical 【】 of people such as Picasso and Aaron Copland .	
As both composer and critic he touched both 【】 of the coin : A climate of receptivity is what the artist most desires .

Apart from Kevin Moseley 's steady supply from the line-out , there was nothing much to commend in a Welsh forward effort which reverted to the very worst Eighties stereotype of static , cumbersome 【】 only too willing to slow the game to walking pace .	
He was scragged by Mike Budd , Jeremy Cooper came away with the ball , Owain Williams acted as the link , and Kevin Ellis scored : three back-row forwards and their scrum-half in perfect 【】 .

A 【】 for the brick cathedral facing St Paul 's : Bankside Power Station is a masterpiece worth , preserving , Gavin Stamp argues	
FROM the top of the dome of St Paul 's Cathedral the view is no longer dominated by City church steeples but by an intrusive 【】 of drab , characterless Sixties boxes .	
The project was controversial and the power station was only permitted providing the smoke was clean and the building did not 【】 the visual dominance of St Paul 's .	
Scott 's first venture into this unlikely 【】 of design was at Battersea where , in 1930 , he was wheeled in as a famous knighted architect by the London Power Company to try to make acceptable the coal-fired monster power station to which the residents of Chelsea and Westminster were taking strong exception .	
As a result , he was able to create a symmetrical , monumental composition of great 【】 .

While the first 【】 of popular interest arose with the 1982 Whitechapel exhibition instigated by Laura Mulvey and Peter Wollen , it was the publication of Hayden Herrera 's biography of Kahlo in 1983 which has led to her current cult status .

It is her body as the 【】 , her appearance as art .	
It is her body as the canvas , her appearance as 【】 .	
Of course , the 【】 between art and life is a particularly hard one to draw in Kahlo 's case .	
The particularities of post-revolutionary Mexico are frequently subsumed by the decorativeness of the ethnic , by the generalised 【】 of the radical avant-garde .	
For Kahlo , however , choosing to don the costume of the Tehuana , as for example in Tree of Hope ( 1946 ) ( Fig. 8 ) , was to embody a powerful 【】 of cultural identity .	
Kahlo 's adoption of Tehuana dress , while being an attractive 【】 of what she saw as a less than perfect body , asserted both a feminist and an anti-colonialist position .	
In Kahlo 's work there is a powerful 【】 of these discourses , yet her role as an archetypal woman painter has come to dominate responses to her work .	
The fascination with functions of the body , the analogies between artistic and physical creative processes , self-portraiture used to reveal the female body as the 【】 of patriarchal aesthetic discourse ; all of these mirror the concerns of many women painters of the 1980s .

This is done by a series of 【】 ; the past versus the present ; female nature versus masculine technology ; growth versus exploitation ; and in its very material presence , the traditions of fine art versus the popular .

There is an argument that treason is a more serious offence , since it strikes at the very 【】 of the State and its social organizations , but treason is so rare that it is surely permissible to treat homicide as the most serious form of crime .	
In other words , does English criminal law pick out the most heinous forms of killing as murders and manslaughters , or are the 【】 frozen by tradition ?	
It was argued in Chapter 2 that the criminal law ought to spread its 【】 wider where the potential harm is greater .	
The mandatory penalty does indeed serve to mark out murder from other crimes , but whether the definition of murder is sufficiently refined to 【】 the worst killings , and only the worst killings , remains to be discussed below .	
The same applies to the general deterrent argument : its effectiveness depends on whether the penalty for murder affects the 【】 of potential killers at all , and , if it does , whether life imprisonment is seen as significantly more or less severe than the alternative of a long , fixed-term sentence .	
In procedural terms , therefore , the life sentence involves a 【】 of function : normally it is the judge who determines the sentence ( or at least its upper limit , since earlier release on parole may be possible ) , whereas a life sentence entrusts that function to the executive , who must first ascertain the opinions of the Lord Chief Justice and the trial judge .	
Whatever the justifications for introducing this policy , it serves to 【】 the fact that sentencing in murder cases is enacted without each case being considered individually , after hearing representations from the offender 's counsel , and without a sentence announced in court and subject to appeal .	
That proposal , if implemented , would 【】 almost all the decision-making in homicide cases from the trial to the sentencing stage : the only issue of any consequence in most cases would be the sentence to be imposed , and all the distinctions now drawn at the stage of criminal liability would be reflected in the sentence alone .	
Moreover , the 【】 between the various degrees would raise questions of law , which would provide much opportunity for legal argument and for appeals .	
The result would be that killings were classified and labelled in a more refined way , but at the 【】 of lengthy trials and mounting legal-aid bills .	
That would have the merit of simplicity , but would it 【】 the right note socially ?	
Yet if the example is modified a little , so that the overtaking is on a country road at night and the risk is known to be slight , it becomes questionable whether the causing of death in these circumstances should be labelled in the same 【】 as intentional killings .	
In discussing the 【】 of murder , we are concerned with classification , not exculpation .	
Can a satisfactory 【】 be drawn here ?	
One approach would be to draw the 【】 by reference to the degree of probability .	
A second approach is to 【】 the law in such a way as to make it clear that the court should make a moral judgment on the gravity of the defendant 's conduct .	
Admittedly , the Model Penal Code does contain a list of circumstances which may amount to extreme indifference , which assists the courts and increases the predictability of verdicts in a way that Scots law does not , but the essence of both 【】 is that there is no precise way of describing those non-intentional killings which are as heinous as intentional killings .	
Neither an intention to cause serious injury nor recklessness as to death should be sufficient on its own , but together they restrict one another , producing a test which both satisfies the criterion of certainty and 【】 out some heinous but non-intended killings .	
Plainly , this is a form of constructive criminal liability : the murder conviction is constructed out of the 【】 of a lesser offence .	
Presumably the justification is that D has already crossed a high moral/social 【】 in choosing to commit such a serious offence , and should therefore be held liable for whatever consequences ensue , however unforeseeable they may be .	
The 【】 is that the traditional concepts of intention and recklessness do not , of themselves , appear to be sufficiently well focused to mark out those killings which are the most heinous .	
Relief was at 【】 .	
The farm stands on a spur of moorland on the northern edge of the forest , and within 10 minutes I had turned my back on the corduroy 【】 of trees and was striding under a still , cloudy sky over tussocks of rush and coarse grass , with my face to the long , bare shoulders of open hillside that flank the winding shallows of the East Kielder Burn .

Paul Harrison 's Inside the Inner City : Life under the Cutting 【】 focused on Hackney , a London borough ranked among the worst off on any scale of urban deprivation ( Harrison , 1983 ) .	
Harrison describes ( p. 369 ) the way in which the inner urban powder-keg leads to a vicious 【】 , with many victims , but few individual villains :

Harrison 's 【】 of a nightmarish future for inner cities , locked in a cold or hot war between have-nots and the forces of public order , was echoed by Robert Chesshyre ( 1987 , p. 95 ) , who concluded that by the late 1980s :

The most striking feature of this 【】 , apart from its aim actively to involve employers and entrepreneurs , is a sharp reduction in the role of local government .	
The White Paper drew on studies conducted earlier in the decade in Liverpool , Birmingham , and London which pointed to a debilitating 【】 of capital and skilled labour from the critical areas of deprivation .	
A key aspect of the 1977 White Paper was the 【】 it placed on the wider effects of poverty : that it was not just those with acute needs who suffered .	
It argued that in talking about inner cities it was vital to think in terms not just of individuals , but of society ; that the multiple deprivations of the worst hit areas affected all the residents ; that the consequences included a pervasive sense of neglect and 【】 , a decline in community spirit , a low standard of neighbourhood facilities , and an increase in crime and vandalism ; and that , without government intervention , the future was one of reduced job opportunities , deteriorating housing , and a decline in public services .	
None of them , of course , anticipated the scale of the problems which were caused by the slump and 【】 of much of what remained of inner urban manufacturing industry in the early 1980s .	
True , the new Secretary of State for the Environment laid stress , from the outset , on the need for economic 【】 , and indicated his sympathy for the voluntary sector in the tackling of urban problems .	
Indeed , while with one 【】 trying to hold down expenditure by local authorities , the Government found itself by the late 1980s involved with the other hand in massive ear-marked spending on inner urban areas .

MAKING 【】 OF THE 1981 RIOTS	
Other reactions have concentrated on the issue of the interplay between inner-city 【】 and racial disadvantage in contemporary Britain .	
Yet others have argued that the unrest can be seen as a 【】 of the breakdown of law and order in British society ( Gaffney , 1987 ; Hall , 1987 ; Keith , 1987 ) .	
Yet others have argued that the unrest can be seen as a symptom of the 【】 of law and order in British society ( Gaffney , 1987 ; Hall , 1987 ; Keith , 1987 ) .	
Any substantive disagreement centred around the issue of what 【】 social deprivation and unemployment had in bringing young people to protest violently on the streets .	
The importance of this debate can be explained , partly , by the political capital which the Opposition could make from linking the social and economic 【】 of the country at large with violent street disturbances .	
While a number of discussions of the 【】 of urban unrest in the United States have noted the salience of political marginality in determining participation in violent protests ( Skolnick , 1969 ; Fogelson , 1971 ; Edelman , 1971 ; Knopf , 1975 ) , this issue has received relatively little attention in Britain .	
A successful policy for tackling the 【】 of urban disorder was seen as one which sought to involve all the community in dealing with the problems of each area so that they could come to feel that they have a stake in its future ( Scarman , 1981 , para. 6.42 ) .

Such a move towards greater political integration was seen by Lord Scarman as essential if the 【】 between inner-city residents and the forces of law and order was to be bridged .	
But the concern with overcoming political marginality remained on the 【】 of the main public debate because it questioned the perception of the rioters as driven by irrational , uncivilized , and criminal instincts .	
This did not , however , stop the question of political marginality and the need to reform existing policies from being raised at all , as can be seen subsequently by the attempts after 1981 to introduce both locally and nationally measures which were meant to 【】 some of the grievances of the rioters and to ensure that further disturbances did not occur .	
We 【】 a common sorrow .	
Indeed , throughout September and October 1985 , and during the following months , the 【】 of race continued to dominate debate about both the causes and the policy outcomes of the riots .	
But the Government did find a way of accepting a 【】 between the riots and social problems without bringing its main policies into the debate : namely by linking the growth of violent disorder to crime and drugs .

Numerous examples of this 【】 of argument can be found in Dear 's report on Handsworth , and in press coverage during the riots .	
The issue of drugs provided an everyday 【】 , already a national issue through saturation media coverage and public debate , around which the police , the Home Office , and other institutions could depoliticize the riots .

Given the extent to which geographic information management is applications driven , it is important to consider in some depth the characteristics of some potential application 【】 .	
In effect the 【】 of the discussion in both parts is a matrix where the methodological issues are listed along one axis and particular applications fields on the other .	
Brown 's chapter on geodemographics discusses an application 【】 where primary data collected for operational purposes are typically evaluated in relation to secondary data derived from sources such as the Census of Population .

This 【】 the challenges for research in a field categorized by a lack of data for some countries , varying definitions and standards in use , and unreasonably high user expectations .	
More generally , we need to consider the availability of large databases for hazard studies and emergency planning and this is an 【】 ripe for major initiatives .	
As noted above , the work of Fedra ( 1989 ) is a major 【】 in this direction , and links need to be forged between initiatives in the UK and the rest of Europe .

Indeed , working directly with consultants proves invaluable in gaining 【】 to high-quality morbidity data .	
It would be a useful management 【】 , particularly in view of the reorganization taking place in the National Health Service .	
Here , in our view , is a classic case of the absence of a geographical 【】 rendering the data of limited value .	
In some cases , good hazard data exist but have simply not yet found their 【】 into a GIS .	
A case in 【】 is inland and coastal flooding .	
Another way in which there needs to be a 【】 between statistical methods and GIS is in the area of spatial sampling and estimation from spatial samples .	
We may want to count numbers living within 【】 , circles of fixed radius , buffer zones and so on .	
Within some sophisticated GIS such as ARC/INFO there are some useful algorithms ( such as shortest path calculations ) , but GIS developers have in general failed to realize the natural 【】 between GIS functions and many operations research techniques .	
Over the last 20 years or so a large theoretical literature has been developed to provide 【】 for the solution of many problems associated with emergency planning ( Kolesar 1981 ) .

In seconds , poor old George would be spread around the room like an 【】 in Harrod 's window , and the thing would be away .

Like a 【】 , it moved out of the aisle between machines , then stopped , and became utterly motionless .	
Nell would never rest until she could get closer to confirm her worst suspicions , and paradoxically it was the woman in her that provided the intensity of emotion that would let nothing stand in her 【】 .	
George , the sacrificial 【】 , had n't emitted a squeak for a long time .	
Instantly alert , Forster checked through his 【】 port .	
When she checked through the spyhole it was standing in exactly the same spot , unmoving , like a 【】 .	
Worried , Delaney followed , searching her face , fearing the tell-tale 【】 of toxicity .	
And Forster 's 【】 's on the line .	
And Forster 's neck 's on the 【】 .	
Delaney knew there was no way she would be shifted from her chosen 【】 .	
Ordering her would be ludicrous under the changed circumstances , and in any event , a 【】 of time .	
He could n't 【】 it , but it reminded him strongly of something .	
Forster was sorely tempted to 【】 out and confirm that the noise was coming from George by twiddling the volume and tuner , but fought down the urge .	
Forster reached for his mask , just as the hissing gas noise sounded right on 【】 of him , ending with a little shriek .	
And something else ; something he saw as the curtain tore away and he looked into the 【】 of the unbelievable face above him , fractionally dulled his reflexes .	
Once free of the knotted 【】 of the eastern suburbs , Dalgliesh made good time and by three he was driving through Lydsett village .	
Here a right turn took him off the coastal road on to what was little more than a smoothly macadamed track bordered by water-filled ditches and fringed by a golden 【】 of reeds , their lumbered heads straining in the wind .	
It swung open at his touch but closing it , as always , was more difficult and he lugged and half lifted it into place and slipped the circle of wire over the gatepost with a familiar sensation of having turned his back on the workaday 【】 and entered country which , no matter how frequent his visits , would always be alien territory .

To his right the ground rose gently towards the southern cliffs and he could see the dark 【】 of a concrete pillbox , undemolished since the war , and as seemingly indestructible as the great hulks of wave-battered concrete , remnants of the old fortifications which lay half-submerged in the sand along part of the beach .	
And now he was passing a second and more dilapidated pillbox and it struck him that the whole headland had the desolate look of an old battlefield , the corpses long since carted away but the air vibrating still with the gunfire of long-lost battles , while the power station loomed over it like a grandiose modern 【】 to the unknown dead .	
In her publicity photographs she could , he recalled , look beautiful in a somewhat intimidating , intellectual and very English 【】 .	
But seen face to face , even in the informality of her own house , the absence of a 【】 of sexuality and , he sensed , a deep-seated reserve , made her seem less feminine and more formidable than he had expected , and she held herself stiffly as if repelling invaders of her personal space .

Or was it that the kitchen reminded Dalgliesh of that rectory kitchen where the lonely only child had found 【】 and undemanding , uncensorious companionship , been given hot dripping toast and small forbidden treats ?	
The faces of the twins , softer 【】 of her own , turned towards her questioningly then broke into shy smiles .	
The solid uncooperative bundle was surprisingly heavy ; it was like trying to 【】 a firm and rather smelly poultice .

After a few more minutes she became restless , and stood up again , her eyes searching the slope of the hillside and the valley below , trying to determine whether some small movement down there was a man on horseback or merely a 【】 of her imagination .	
She had let her overwhelming desire 【】 her imagination ; had read something into his words , his looks , his actions , which had not been there at all .

They prepared chicken pies , the pastry as light as Ruth 's 【】 , turtle soup , a haunch of venison , jellies , blancmanges , syllabubs , trifles , and a host of other dishes , with still more to be done on the day of the party itself .

His face was old and young , sardonic and knowing , amused and handsome ; the face of a man who has seen the world 's wickedness and knows how to 【】 it with his own .	
His long black hair was tied into its ponytail with a velvet ribbon , his skin was 【】 pale , and his eyes dark .	
Precautions are the 【】 of small and fearful minds .

The drift had become a 【】 of overgrowth that dripped water on to the roof of the van .	
At the top they came out into uncompromising , bright grey light , the bleak , hedgeless lane , the flat meadows where here and there stunted trees squatted like old 【】 in cloaks .	
Sitting alone , he lit his cigarette , the first of the day , and there came that faint 【】 in the head , a tautening of the gut .	
If it comes to 【】 that I was in that house with Adam and the others , he thought with cold clarity , if someone tells the papers , or the police and thence the papers , that I was there during the summer of 1976 , living there , it will be all up with me .

Normally routines are single 【】 of instructions although it is possible to have some conditional branching .	
No great skill or intellectual effort is required , which is one way of saying that the human operator is being under-used , but the purpose of a routine is usually to avoid common human error such as omitting a 【】 or reversing steps .

The poem highlights two important twelfth-century developments : the use of force in punishing aristocratic crime ( the 【】 of princely peace-keeping ) , and the increasing significance of siege-engines in warfare .	
Henry II 's castle at Chinon , where the treasury of Anjou was situated , was the model for its 【】 , with its halls , upper chambers , tower , and curtain walling , set on a high point above a strategic crossing of the Loire .	
Similarly , campaigning in the field imposed an increasing financial 【】 .	
Inevitably , therefore , war on the grand 【】 as fought by princes bore little resemblance in practice to the feuds of lesser men .	
The divergence was sharpened by the application of a theoretical distinction , the 【】 of Augustinian theology , amplified as the century went on by canon and Roman law reference ; princes pronounced their campaigns just wars ( fought against aggressors with the aim of re-establishing peace ) or public wars ( declared by a competent authority in the public interest ) , while they condemned the wars of lesser men as infractions of the peace .	
So it could be a powerful 【】 .	
The contrast with the united 【】 Louis VI and his troops presented to the emperor Henry V in 1124 was marked .	
This goes some 【】 to explaining why the complicated campaigns within Toulouse in the second half of the century were largely fought out under the banners of the Angevin , Aragonese , and French kings ; and why the revolts of Henry II 's sons had widespread ramifications .	
The 【】 caused problems , in that the circumstances which might trigger off renewed fighting were unpredictable ; yet the moment an opportunity offered , princes had to be prepared for invading their enemies ; there was no time for lengthy preparation .	
John of Marmoutier 's life of Geoffrey le Bel offers a 【】 of how strong bonds were created between the prince and his followers within the household , and how a high level of training was maintained at all times .

It was within this kind of environment that chivalry flourished , that young men learned to identify , their vassalage towards their lord as a 【】 of their honour , that they debated the relative merits of Roland 's and Oliver 's way of displaying loyalty ; and that they learned the finer points of jousting .	
that of an instruction in the martial arts compatible with the maintenance of a prince 's peace ; that of an 【】 for competitive instincts within the claustrophobic confines of a court ; and that of display to maintain princely social status .	
All this formed a 【】 to the first century of crusading ; and it goes some way to explaining the more secular aspects of the magnetism which drew French knights to take up the cross in their thousands .

While Raymond of Toulouse remained in Outremer , Stephen and Hugh disgraced themselves in escaping from the siege of Antioch , and Robert Curthose , no matter how gallant , at least in his lifetime failed to impress , Robert II 's prestige soared to the 【】 .	
Outside Flanders , Robert 's sister 's marriage to Roger of Sicily was a mark of his new 【】 in the world ; like Louis VI 's sister 's marriage to Bohemond of Antioch , it stretched French kinship connections into the new Norman colonies , ensuring that travellers from the homeland would find a welcome in those distant parts .	
For other French houses a commitment to Outremer often represented a 【】 of domestic political interest .	
On occasion , their determination to sacrifice for Christ played directly into their overlord 's 【】 , as when the count of La Marche , who had no direct heir , sold his county to King Henry II in 1177 .	
When it did not , accompanying their princes in a joint crusading venture , as the lord of Amboise accompanied Fulk V or Hugh VI de Lusignan William IX , created new personal 【】 .	
The political 【】 from crusading are therefore more difficult to calculate than at first glance they might appear .	
His noble 【】 appeased those churchmen who had been appalled by his early obstinacy over the archbishopric of Bourges .	
The great joint expeditions , the combined leaderships , although not without 【】 , had been justified by their outstanding achievement , the conquest and maintenance of Jerusalem .

The party was in a mutinous condition in November 1911 and there was no apparent successor who would have even half of Balfour 's political 【】 .	
The shock caused by Balfour 's going thus did something to steady the party and it certainly produced a real determination to settle the affairs of the party with less 【】 than had been fashionable of late .	
Long was supported by the 【】 of the English county members but by few of the party 's men of talent .	
Chamberlain provided the 【】 out by suggesting to Balcarres that both he and Long should withdraw and so allow Law to be elected unanimously ; he also turned down Balcarres 's remarkable advice that he should allow Long to be elected since Long would make such a mess of things that Chamberlain would be bound to succeed within the year .

It was in June 1911 that the first 【】 of disorder were mounted in the House of Commons , led by Lord Hugh Cecil .	
In August 1911 the diehard peers used language as violent as any that Law was to use later , and in the crucial decision on the House of Lords Law sided with the hedgers rather than the 【】 .	
Before he succeeded Balfour then , Law was not associated with any of the features that were to characterize his party leadership ; his contribution was to use the leadership in the 【】 of all of these causes , to make himself the spokesman for the most spirited sections of the party .

Their respective positions explain this in part : as ex-Prime Minister and a considerable figure in his own right , Balfour had the confidence to believe in his own judgement even when isolated from the bulk of the party ; as the tertium quid in the recent contest , Law had neither the 【】 nor the confidence to take such a detached view .

In later conversations about Ulster , Law was frank enough to point out that bloodshed in Ulster would be the best way of ensuring an electoral 【】 for the Unionists .	
From the party viewpoint Law 's methods were successful but dangerous ; expectations raised when the party was in full cry were not easily set aside for an eventual compromise , and the only outcome that would fully vindicate the methods was the 【】 of power .	
In parliament there would be a carefully organized 【】 of resistance that would at least slow the government down and raise Unionist morale .

To pay for this outpouring , a great 【】 was mounted for additional income -by Farquhar and Steel-Maitland .	
The method adopted was to canvass for capital donations that could then be invested to bring in a regular income , and both Balfour and Law were used to raise the 【】 .	
Under Malcolm Fraser the party began to make effective use of its 【】 in Fleet Street .	
This was the 【】 of the problem : the press could only be managed by someone who knew their methods and who would not expect them to come round to Central Office to search for news .

The other 【】 of press management , depending on informal contacts , is less easy to assess .	
Law personally conducted the negotiations with Gardner Sinclair over the sale of the Observer and the Pall Mall Gazette in 1914 ; this negotiation also demonstrates that , as well as producing information and 【】 editors , the party had to work hard to keep some of the newspapers in business .	
Such investments had a double purpose , for they could bring in income and provide a political 【】 .	
It was usual to 【】 some form of guarantee in exchange for party support but the secrecy prevented such undertakings from being enforced .

This was in itself a striking 【】 on what had already been done : Liberal Unionists who had resisted amalgamation under Balfour and Acland-Hood in 1911 acquiesced meekly under Law and Steel-Maitland in 1912 .	
On the other 【】 , the independence of the Tariff Reform League was a positive advantage : after January 1913 the party supported the tariff policy but was not including them in its immediate programme , so that Central Office could continue to distribute tariff propaganda from the TRL without compromising party policy .	
In general , efforts to ensure better coordination were a matter of the patient 【】 up of contacts , although the improved party morale and the greater efficiency of Central Office had removed their justification for existence .

Experience with practical calculations helps , but even after years of work one usually remains this 【】 of infallibility .	
It is possible to study electromagnetic theory without ever mentioning the word electron , but since it has become such a 【】 word and is used so often we can just as well make use of it .	
If the cross-section happens to be smaller at a certain place , then the forces are larger there than at the neighbouring cross-sections , so the beam will be further constricted , etc. , leading to the so-called 【】 instability ( Fig. 3.3(a) ) .

He stared at the serenely impassioned garden made out of a whirl of yellow brushstrokes , a viridian impasto , a dense mass of furiously feathered 【】 of blue-green , isolated black pot hooks , the painfully clear orange-red spattering .	
He would have been lying if he had recorded only the more accessible 【】 of the painter 's electric quarrels with Gauguin in the Yellow House in Arles , the distant necessary brother who supplied paint and love , the severed ear delivered to the whore in the brothel , the asylum fears .	
The yellow chair , besides being brushstrokes and pigment , besides being a yellow chair , was one of twelve bought for a company of artists who were to inhabit the Yellow House , the white walls of which should 【】 with sunflowers as the windows of Gothic cathedrals blazed with coloured light .	
Good Lord ! it did make an 【】 on me , reading the letters of those men .	
The 【】 of it , Alexander thought .	
The eternal 【】 of Provence .	
To suggest it , that is the 【】 . '	
It was not a 【】 of things with which Frederica was entirely in sympathy : she liked naming names .	
But she looked briefly down , dazzled by the flowing 【】 of worked and delicate colour ; the blue and rose tourbillons of the mistral on the sea , the prismatically sliced frosty nimbus round the mysterious squat stacks .	
Although he was fourteen years younger than Alexander , Daniel too was in the habit of thinking of himself as a 【】 , a battered and grizzled survivor .

Alexander , always a connoisseur of garments , realised that Frederica had changed her style , that the clothes the young creatures were wearing could be described as a 【】 of the clothes Frederica had worn at their age , and that Frederica 's new style was not unrelated to this shift .	
She took the 【】 eagerly .	
I remember when I thought lipstick had gone forever , a 【】 of painted excess , as I thought paper taffeta had gone forever , in Cambridge , when we all took to glazed cotton .	
' Oh , I 'm in my 【】 .	
This is my 【】 . '	
Like many hirsute men he had thinned a little on top where once his black 【】 had been extravagant , but he had a plentiful and prickling black beard , and his body was still compact and very heavy .	
His smooth brown hair was as thick as ever but shot now with 【】 of glittering silver .	
Frederica informed him from the catalogue that the vegetation was supposed to be a jocular portrait by Gauguin of Madeleine , the 【】 her breasts , the dense flowers her hair .

' You could read it another way , ' said Alexander , interested now , ' you could read the pears as androgynous in themselves , as partly 【】 . '	
' You like to 【】 for your images , do n't you , Alexander ? '	
He was in 【】 from his family , his dead alter ego , his uncertain sense of identity .	
But one side branch shoots up very high and lets fall an 【】 of dark green pine needles .	
( Though in Van Gogh 's case , the names , Theodorus , Vincent , Vincent , Theodorus , appeared and reappeared from generation to generation , the cultural 【】 to certain persisting aspects of the family face , a heavy brow , an intense blue eye , a cheek bone , a nostril . )	
Ann Maguire had borne a second Joanne , in New Zealand , from where she had returned , unable to bear cultural 【】 .	
Daniel , who had become a specialist in wild 【】 of chance , thought he understood some of it .	
He had metaphorically shaken a large 【】 , impotently , at some looming energy-field , and got on with his work , his work .	
He had metaphorically shaken a large fist , impotently , at some looming 【】 , and got on with his work , his work .	
Daniel was used to such language ; it was his daily , or anyway weekly , 【】 .	
He knew about the 【】 shining in darkness , and had come , for reasons completely different from Alexander 's desire for exactness , specificity , to mistrust figurative language .	
He knew about the light shining in 【】 , and had come , for reasons completely different from Alexander 's desire for exactness , specificity , to mistrust figurative language .	
But he liked the black Dutch paintings : they were , so to speak , on his 【】 .	
Judging 【】 in the family . '	
I do n't want the 【】 , the pain , the mess , or the misery of being in love .	
I do n't want the disorder , the 【】 , the mess , or the misery of being in love .

You clearly think that you 're a 【】 of worthless rubbish , and if I pick up those vibes , then so do the blokes .	
You clearly think that you 're a piece of worthless 【】 , and if I pick up those vibes , then so do the blokes .	
You never want to make a man the 【】 of your existence .	
Half an hour after the inspector left , as if to prove his 【】 , the lavatory refused to flush .	
As the Rallye droned towards the lighthouse on the tip of Cap Camerat , Miranda felt as if she were 【】 the air of the gods .	
As the Rallye droned towards the lighthouse on the tip of Cap Camerat , Miranda felt as if she were breathing the 【】 of the gods .

Miranda felt that the aircraft was an 【】 of her arms and her fingertips , outspread in flight .	
Miranda pushed 【】 this advantage .	
Nine hundred years earlier , the great hall had been the 【】 of castle life : wolfhounds ate on floors strewn with rushes ; servants slept on straw pallets thrown on the floor .	
Elinor was sometimes at a 【】 for the right word , or name , and then became impatient with herself ; she was often frustrated because she could n't move as swiftly as she did before .	
Leaves and yellow blossoms obscured the top of the window , while the bottom was covered by aggressive pink hollyhocks , seemingly determined to fight their 【】 inside .	
So kindly curb your theatrical , James Bond 【】 .	
I 'm on your 【】 , Adam .	
Annabel was determined to get a 【】 on herself and do as Scott advised : remember 1965 as the year she stopped having to go to auditions and 1966 as the year in which she blossomed into a successful young New York hostess as she met Andy Warhol , Lenny Bernstein , Baby Jane Holzer , and all the other gossip-columnist fodder .

He decided to turn the 【】 on the Russian .	
Bastard Russians were still upto their old 【】 .	
We had centuries of 【】 to fall back on .	
His code-name was Lucy and his network , the Lucy 【】 .	
The British were involved with them through us and it was their advanced work on breaking cyphers that enabled the 【】 to establish such a great record .	
Sorge was annoyed with himself , irritated that he had allowed the Intelligence man to get under his 【】 .	
Many were Nazis , but businessmen and professionals were also our 【】 .	
They remembered the Lucy network , their 【】 out of Germany .	
The importance of it did n't 【】 until Germany was reunified .	
The Exec Director did n't want his dirty 【】 wrung out in front of this Russian .

Wondering what the 【】 he 's upto .	
And if he could remember where the shop was , he 'd go back and sue the 【】 .	
Even so , no room to swing a 【】 .
